    1) Generate spikes for 10 s (or longer if you want better statistics) using
    a Poisson spike generator with a constant rate of 100 Hz, and record
    their times of occurrence. Compute the coeffcient of variation of the
    interspike intervals, and the Fano factor for spike counts obtained
    over counting intervals ranging from 1 to 100 ms. Plot the interspike
    interval histogram.
